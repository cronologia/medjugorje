# AGENTS.md — cronologia/medjugorje

Operating guide for AI coding agents (and humans) working in this repository.
Read this and `context.md` before making changes. The shared method lives in
`cronologia/core` (skills: sourcing-rules, bootstrap-project, mine-video,
dossier-research); the architecture rationale in `cronologia/fsp` → `docs/adrs/`.

## What this project is

A compiled static website documenting the chronology of **the reported Marian
apparitions at Medjugorje (1981–present) and the Church's acts about them**.
A single JSON file is the source of truth; a zero-dependency Node script
compiles it into static HTML served by GitHub Pages.

## Multi-language (i18n) & SEO

The site ships in **English (default, authoritative), Spanish and Portuguese**.
`es`/`pt` are **machine-translated** from the committed caches in `data/i18n/`
and carry a visible "machine-translated" disclaimer. The language is a path
segment **after** the project (`/<repo>/{en|pt|es}/…`) because GitHub Pages
serves each repo under `https://<org>.github.io/<repo>/`; `/<repo>/` redirects
to the visitor's locale. See `adrs/0001-multilingual.md` and `cronologia/core#9`.

- **No backend, ever.** The site is static HTML on GitHub Pages; nothing
  translates at runtime. `es`/`pt` are **pre-authored, committed** caches in
  `data/i18n/` baked into the static pages at build time. Fill them by authoring
  the translations and committing them; `node scripts/translate.js --stats`
  reports which strings still need one. (An env-configured MT service is an
  optional convenience — not required.) Keep them fresh when English changes.
- Localization is **data-level** (a key-based walk in `build.js`), so every
  renderer — chronology, genealogy, charts, glossary links — is covered.
- **Never translated:** reference titles/publishers, proper names, URLs, dates, ids.
- **Subtrees where the general rule misfires get their own allowlist.**
  `TRANSLATABLE_KEYS` decides the dataset at large; `SUBTREE_TRANSLATABLE` in
  `build.js` maps a subtree's key to the keys that are prose *inside* it, and
  the walk resolves it as it descends (nearest enclosing subtree wins, and it
  is sticky). `references` ships: bibliography passes through verbatim except
  `publisherNote`, which is the project's own voice. A repo whose dataset has
  another such subtree adds one entry in the `subtree-allowlists` ADOPT block —
  in `olavo`, a bibliography where `note`/`sourceNote`/`label`/`blurb`/`role`/
  `when` are prose and `title` is a book's name and must not be translated.
  `test/i18n-completeness.test.js` parses that map and MIRRORS the walk; its
  last test drives `localizeData` with a marking dictionary and asserts the two
  select exactly the same strings, so the audit cannot drift from the compiler
  in either direction.
- Each page emits localized `<title>`/description/OG/Twitter, a self canonical,
  `hreflang` (en/es/pt + x-default) and JSON-LD; the build also writes
  `sitemap.xml` (with hreflang alternates) and `robots.txt`.

## Optional visualizations (data-driven, off by default)

The compiler renders extra visual sections only when the corresponding key
exists in `data/chronology.json`; when a key is absent the output is
byte-identical to a build without the feature. Shapes are shown in
`data/chronology.example.json`; the validator checks all of them.

- **`meta.vizChips[]`** — header pill links to the visual sections
  (`{ "href": "#lineage", "label": "🌳 Genealogy" }`).
- **`approvalLadder`** — for reported apparitions and other cases that escalate
  through named authorities: one rung per authority, rendered **at the top of
  the page**, above `about`. The canonical shape is local inquiry (parish priest
  or diocesan investigator) → the bishop's commission and judgment → referral to
  Rome and its outcome, but the rungs are declared in data, so a case that never
  left the diocese declares two, and a case Rome ruled on twice about different
  objects declares two Roman rungs.

  Four rules the renderer enforces, each with a reason:

  1. **No overall verdict is ever rendered**, and adding one is a regression.
     La Salette is the proof: the apparition was declared worthy of belief in
     1851 and Mélanie's expanded secrets were condemned in 1915 and 1923.
     Different judgments about different objects — one badge would have to
     misreport one of them.
  2. **`status` is a closed enum** and an unknown value fails the build:
     `favourable`, `negative`, `inconclusive`, `reported-undocumented`,
     `not-found`, `not-reached`, `pending`. Note the last three are three
     different things. `reported-undocumented` is "a ruling is claimed, no
     document located" (Cimbres, Campinas); `not-found` is "we searched and
     found no sign this step happened"; `not-reached` is "the case demonstrably
     did not go here" (Lourdes never needed Rome). Collapsing them lets an
     unsearched gap read as a settled fact.
  3. **Every rung is cited or says why it cannot be.** A rung with neither
     `sources[]` nor a `noDocument` note fails the build, and the two absence
     statuses require `noDocument` *even with* citations — it must state what
     was searched.
  4. **Status is never colour-only.** Each rung carries a word, a glyph and its
     prose; colour is confirmation.

  Prose fields (`label`, `when`, `who`, `outcome`, `noDocument`, `heading`,
  `note`, `caption`, `navLabel`) are translated via a subtree allowlist.
  `status` is deliberately excluded — it is in `TRANSLATABLE_KEYS` as prose for
  other datasets, and translating it would break the localized build only.
- **`lineage`** (alias `episcopalLineage`, the original fsspx key) — genealogy
  / lineage trees (`renderLineageSection`). One `trees[]` entry per branch;
  `separate: true` sets a branch apart visually for lines that must NOT be
  read as connected (the fsspx Thục/Palmar pattern). **Typed edges**: a node
  with `edge: "indirect"` (plus optional `edgeLabel`) renders a DASHED
  connector — a reference/association, not a direct consecration/initiation —
  and a solid/dashed legend appears automatically (labels overridable via
  `edgeLegend`). With no typed edges the markup is byte-identical to the
  fsspx site's genealogy section. `heading`/`navLabel` default to
  "Episcopal genealogy"/"Genealogy".
- **`branchTimeline`** — horizontal "subway diagram" of an organization's
  divisions (`renderBranchTimeline`): a trunk line with labeled branches
  forking off at dated points (e.g. SSPX → SSPV 1983 → Resistance 2012 →
  2026). Static inline SVG — print scales it to the page via its viewBox;
  on screen it sits in its own horizontal-scroll container (`.viz-scroll`).
  Lanes follow listing order; `from` forks a branch off an earlier branch;
  `end` terminates a branch (dot) instead of running to the right edge.
  Every trunk/branch entry needs `sources[]` — the figure's claims are cited
  in its `<figcaption>` list.
- **`numbersChart`** — contested-numbers / series chart (`renderNumbersChart`):
  for figures that must NOT be silently unified (e.g. a movement's
  self-reported participant count vs. an external survey's population share).
  Each `series[]` is drawn as its OWN panel on its OWN axis, with its OWN
  `unit`, its OWN `sourceLabel` (WHO reported it), and its OWN `sources[]` —
  the series are never merged onto one scale. A required `unitNote` renders the
  explicit **"not directly comparable"** banner. `axisMax` sets that series'
  axis top (defaults to its largest point); each `points[]` entry has a numeric
  `value`, a human-readable attributed `display`, and an optional `year`. The
  `<figcaption>` cites every series. `heading`/`navLabel` default to "Numbers".
  Sits in its own `.viz-scroll` container; prints as static panels.
- **`map`** — country tier map (`renderTierMap`): a static choropleth of the
  vendored Latin America base map, the tl presence-map pattern. Tiers are a
  per-repo, DATA-DECLARED vocabulary (`tiers: [{ id, label }]`, 1–4 entries,
  listing order = visual rank) — what a tier means is an editorial claim, so
  it lives in the data with its legend label, never in the renderer. Each
  `countries[]` entry (`code` ISO alpha-2, must exist in src/latam.svg;
  `name`; `tier`; cited `note`) fills its country and gets a hover/focus
  tooltip (aria-live caption) plus a citation card. `unlistedLabel` is
  REQUIRED: on a contested subject, an unfilled country is a statement too,
  and the legend must say what it means. Distinct from `placesMap` (event
  pins): this says what KIND of place a country is in the story, not where
  events happened. fsp's year-slider membership map is a declared follow-up
  (core#3), not covered by this key yet.

- **`meta.threads`** — the per-repo lane taxonomy (core#23) and, once declared,
  the **swimlanes** figure (`renderSwimlanes`): one row per lane, one column per
  decade, each cell that lane's event count, rendered as a real `<table>`
  because the data is categorical-over-time. Declaring a taxonomy is what turns
  the figure on — a classification the site keeps but never shows would be
  latent editorialising. Three rules the renderer enforces and any redesign must
  keep: `meta.threads.note` renders WITH the figure (it is the visible statement
  that the lanes are a reading); every lane's `basis` renders below it with its
  citations; and lane labels render VERBATIM, because a label may carry a
  load-bearing hedge ("Antecedents (attributed, not adopted)"). Gap collapsing is
  shared with the spine via `decadeColumns()`, so two figures on one page cannot
  disagree about the same gap.

Print baseline: `src/styles.css` ships an `@media print` block (nav/chips
hidden, figures `break-inside: avoid`, the subway SVG scaled to page width) —
extend it when adding a new visualization.

## Thread lanes (optional, off by default — schema only; renderer pending, core#23)

Events may carry `threads: string[]` naming which parallel storyline(s) an
event belongs to (always an array — cross-cutting events belong to more than
one). The vocabulary is **per-repo and editorial**: it must be declared in
`meta.threads`, never invented in code or derived by clustering the text:

```json
"meta": {
  "threads": {
    "note": "<visible editorial statement: these lanes are a reading of the chronology, not a neutral fact>",
    "lanes": [
      { "id": "rome-relations", "label": "Relations with Rome",
        "basis": "<what grounds this lane — the actor's own periodization, a scholarly framework… cite it>",
        "sources": ["optional-ref-id"] }
    ]
  }
}
```

`scripts/validate-data.js` enforces: unknown lane id on an event → error;
`threads` used without a declared taxonomy → error; missing `note` or a lane
missing `basis` → error; **absent field → valid** (no flag day), and a dataset
without the key builds byte-identically. Choosing the lanes is an editorial
decision governed by the sourcing-rules skill ("Thread taxonomies are a
reading") — decide and record it per repo before tagging events. The swimlane
renderer is a follow-up (core#23 → #22); until it ships the field is inert in
the build.

## Glossary cross-links (optional, off by default)

Prose fields can link into the shared **Cronologia glossary**
(`https://cronologia.github.io/glossary/<term-id>/`) instead of re-explaining a
term, using an inline marker:

- `[[term-id]]` — link whose visible text is the id (e.g. `[[schism]]`).
- `[[term-id|visible text]]` — link with custom visible text
  (e.g. `[[latae-sententiae|latae sententiae]]`).

`term-id` is a glossary slug (`[a-z0-9]` then `[a-z0-9-]*`). Markers are
expanded **after** HTML-escaping and only when a `[[` is present, so a field
with no marker renders byte-for-byte identically to a build without the feature
(the same opt-in contract as the visualizations above). Markers are honored in
the main prose fields: `facts[].value`, `events[].text`, `figures[].role` /
`.notes`, `organizations[].relation` / `.notes`, and `disambiguation.items[].text`.

**Validation is offline and deterministic.** `data/glossary-terms.json` is a
*pinned, vendored* copy of the glossary's term-id list — the build never fetches
it, matching this repo's no-network-in-build rule (only the out-of-band
`archive-refs.js` / `sync-glossary-terms.js` scripts touch the network).
`scripts/validate-data.js` scans every string field for `[[…]]` markers and
**fails the build** on any id not in that pinned list. Refresh the list after
the glossary changes and commit the diff:

```
node scripts/sync-glossary-terms.js                       # sibling ../glossary or the published raw JSON
node scripts/sync-glossary-terms.js ../glossary/data/glossary.json   # explicit local source
```

## Link-health checker (out-of-band / CI only)

The references ARE the product, so link-rot is tracked automatically.
`scripts/check-links.js` reads every `references[].url` and reports, per URL:
its HTTP status (a `HEAD` probe, falling back to a **ranged `GET`** when HEAD is
unsupported or blocked); whether it redirected, plus a **soft-404 heuristic**
(a redirect — or a 200 — whose page `<title>` no longer matches the reference's
declared title, or reads as a not-found/parking page, is flagged **SUSPECT**);
and whether an Internet Archive snapshot exists. A URL that is **dead or suspect
AND has no snapshot** is marked `priorityArchive` — top of the queue for
`scripts/archive-refs.js`.

- **It hits the live network, so it is NEVER part of the build** (the build is
  network-free). Run it out of band or in CI:
  `node scripts/check-links.js --json report.json --md issue.md`.
- **Politeness / semantics:** ≥ 1 request/second (global throttle), a
  User-Agent that names the project, bounded per-request timeout. `403`/`429`
  (and `5xx`/timeouts) are **INCONCLUSIVE, never "dead"** — many publishers
  block bots or HEAD; only real `4xx` (404/410/451…) count as dead.
- **It never edits `data/chronology.json`.** Fixing rot (correct the URL, or
  archive it) is a human decision.
- `.github/workflows/link-health.yml` runs it weekly on GitHub runners
  (`schedule` + `workflow_dispatch`) and opens/updates a **single** "Link health
  report" issue with the failures. Like `wayback.yml`, it runs in CI precisely
  so it never routes around a sandbox's egress policy (fsp ADR-0006).
- Offline helpers (title parsing, the soft-404 rule, status classification, the
  Wayback parser) are unit-tested in `test/link-health.test.js`.

## Working agreements

1. **Edit data, not output.** Change `data/chronology.json`, run
   `node build.js`, commit the regenerated `docs/` in the same change.
2. **Keep the build green.** `node scripts/validate-data.js`, `node --test`
   and `node build.js` must all pass; CI fails if `docs/` drifts.
3. **Cite every fact; flag every uncertainty; attribute every contested
   characterization.** The validator enforces non-empty `sources[]`.
4. **A merged PR is finished** — branch fresh from `main` for new work.

## Data quality & sourcing rules

The five core rules of the sourcing-rules skill apply verbatim: cite it or
flag it; attribute, don't assert; sources span the spectrum by design;
time-sensitive statuses are dated; testimony and video are perspectives, not
fact sources. On top of them, the subject-specific rules of this repo:

1. **Apparitions and messages are REPORTED events.** Every sighting, secret,
   and message in this dataset is somebody's report — say whose. "Alleged
   messages" is Rome's own required framing (DDF Note, 19 Sep 2024), not this
   project's hedge.
2. **An approval is an act about an object (ADR-0007).** The ladder's three
   objects — supernatural character, devotion/pilgrimage, named persons — are
   never merged. Pastoral acts (the Hoser missions, the 2019 pilgrimage
   authorization) are `adjacent`; the 2024 nihil obstat is favourable about
   the devotion and expressly not a supernaturality declaration; the Vlašić
   acts are person-rungs. Informal spoken statements (Žanić 1981, Francis
   in-flight 2017) are chronology events, never rungs — they are not acts.
   New rungs need an object before they need a status.
3. **Mirrors are labeled mirrors.** Zadar 1991, Bertone 1998, the 1987
   communiqué, Žanić 1990 and the Perić texts have no primary institutional
   hosting online; the diocesan site md-tm.ba is unreachable from this
   environment (see context.md). Cite the labeled mirror, say it is a mirror,
   and never upgrade a mirror to "the diocese states".
4. **The Ruini votes are leak-reported.** The commission's findings were never
   published; all vote figures are Tornielli 2017. Every use must carry that
   label. The commission's membership beyond Ruini is press reporting, not
   the communiqué.
5. **Numbers name their counters.** Pilgrim and Communion figures are the
   shrine's own registers or named estimates; no independent count exists.
   Never present a total without its counting authority.
6. **Devotional life-data is flagged.** The seers' births, marriages,
   residences and secret-completion dates rest on devotional literature and
   sympathetic press — `dateVerified: false` with a `dateNote` wherever a
   date has no better witness. Mart Bax's wartime ethnography is excluded as
   a fact source (fabrication finding, VU Amsterdam 2013).
7. **Keep the Caritas of Birmingham disambiguation intact.** medjugorje.com
   is not the shrine; the organization entry and the disambiguation item
   exist so that no reader — and no future edit — conflates them.

**If this project derives a searchable corpus** from PDFs, captions or scans,
it ships a test beside the corpus asserting its SHAPE — nothing ending
mid-sentence, more than one content unit per source document, a size floor and
no runt files, no glyph doubling, and the field the corpus was built to mine
present on every record. A corpus that is silently 20% of itself answers
"never" to questions whose answer is not never; a positive control proves the
search worked, not that the corpus is entire. See
`core/adr/0006-derived-corpora-ship-an-integrity-test.md` and the reference
implementation in `cronologia/fsp` → `test/declaration-corpus.test.js`.
